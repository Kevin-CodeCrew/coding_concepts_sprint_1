# Introduction to Version Control

Git is one of several version control solutions available to developers. Version control systems allow developers to track changes that make to their solutions. Developers create `repositories` or `repos` for short, and add their source code to them. 

These systems allow the developer to see exactly what changes were made to source code (diff), when, and by whom. Developers can even go back to earlier versions should they new to view older versions or rollback recent changes should the need arise. 

While there are many different version control solutions, Git is presently the most popular and what we will be using in class.

# Git
Git is a distributed version control system for tracking the history of your code. It is called a `distributed` because it supports both `local` (on the developer's machine) as well as `remote` repositories stored on servers out on the internet/network. A popular remote repository service and one that we will use in class is `Github` (more about that later).

# Practice
## Creating a Git Repo Locally

## Setting the Username and Email for Git
The first time that you commit anything via Github it will require you to specify the user name and the email address associated with your Github account. You can set and save these settings either for *just* the current repository directory you are in or for all repositories you will work on from your machine. The `-global` option is used to specify that the credentials should be used for all repositories. 

If you intend on interacting with other Github repositories using a different Github user account, then set credentials independently, otherwise, the `-global` option should be used so that you aren't repeatedly prompted for this information.
